### Engineering tools in *Python*, *MATLAB* and *C++*.</br>
Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering Required Tools for Simulations (**FEA**).</br></br>
Here I develop all tools that is required for FEA and other methods for simulating mechanical phenomena.
I am trying to created a large library to be used instead of commercial tools for whom like to treate as an real engineer rather than an operator of software, systems or machines.
This is an open source repository that may contain many modulus and files for engineering.
I have plan to complete it during my PhD course so that everyone can use it as a powerfull tool.</br>
